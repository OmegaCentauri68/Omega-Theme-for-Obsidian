# Omega
Omega is a dark mode-only Obsidian theme designed for those who think in stars. Inspired by the glowing chaos of nebulae and the burning edges of collapsing stars, Omega brings you a vibrant yet immersive palette made for late-night thinking, digital spellcraft, and cosmic-level note-taking.
